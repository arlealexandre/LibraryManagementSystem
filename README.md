# Library Management System

This repository stores a **.NET REST API** built with Clean Architecture principles. 

This project demonstrates a clear separation of concerns by decoupling business logic from infrastructure. 

It provides an interface for creating and listing books, backed by a SQL database for persistent storage.

More details about technical test can be found [here](INSTRUCTIONS.md).
